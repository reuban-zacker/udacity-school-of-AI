    "Finding my starting hyperparameters was a bit of an adventure. I understood from char-rnn that vocab_size and output_size should be the same, and equal to all the unique tokens, but that seemed huge. I picked 5 epochs to start, just to make sure it would train without erros. A lr of 0.001 based on sentiment-rnn (I usually start at 0.01, based on Andew Ng's recommendations, but in this instance, my first goal was to make sure it would train. I started with values from char-rnn, or guesses, and was having cda runtime errors, so I ended up reading through slack, where someone recommened revisiting sentiment-rnn, so I picked my starting embedding_dim of 400 and hidden_dim of 256 from there. I picked n_layers = 2 from char-rnn, as well as sequence_length = 100. When it comes to batch_size, char-rnn had 128, which seemed like it would take forever to train, so I started with 64, but got an error that someone on knowledge had said was likely due to batch size being too high, so I went down to 32. With these parameters I was able to begin training (just for 5 epochs to start). I was pretty excited when it started with a validation loss of 5.84 and had dropped to 4.5 before the first epoch had even finished training. However, my model got stuck around 4.5 and was very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing I tried was removing the dropout layer, which significantly improved speed, though it was still slow. Now it got stuck around 4.1. A bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I tried was raising the clipping parameter from 3 to 10. This seemed to perform a bit better but still get stuck in a similar place after the first epoch. Nevertheless, I had to leave the house for a while, so decided to let it train while I was gone. 8 hrs and 10 epochs later, it had gotten stuck between 3.7-3.9. The next day, I went back to the drawing board, changing parameters one at a time. For try 5, I lowered batch size to 16, which had worse results. Then I experimented with lowering learning rate. This at first seemed to help, but then turned out to have fairly consistent results with what I had before. My model was stuck between 3.7 - 3.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned the problem was with my hyperparameters, most especially I had missed the fact that I was supposed to pick a sequence length that aproximate sentence length, so my squence length was much too high. And I should have trusted the batch size in the sentiment-rnn excercise; my batch size was much too low. So I returned to 0.001 learning rate, with batch size 128, and sequence length of 10. The model was immediately training so much faster and more efficiently!\n",
