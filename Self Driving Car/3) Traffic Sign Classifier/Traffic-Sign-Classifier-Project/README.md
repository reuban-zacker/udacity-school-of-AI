## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I tried out my model on images of German traffic signs that I find on the web.

We have included an Ipython notebook that contains further instructions 
and starter code. I downloaded the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). 

A detailed writeup of the project was created named 'writeup_template.md'. I checked out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and used it as a starting point for creating my own writeup. 

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file 

Creating a Great Writeup
---
A great writeup should include the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) as well as the description of how I addressed each point.  It includes a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  I also include images in the writeup to demonstrate how my code works with examples.  

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```

### Requirements for Submission
Follow the instructions in the `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` notebook and write the project report using the writeup template as a guide, `writeup_template.md`. Submit the project code and writeup document.

## How to write a README
